All it takes is a few quick steps to completely log out of your Google account. Here&rsquo;s how to sign out of your Google account on your Android TV device.</p><p>The first step is to open the Google account settings and select the “Sign Out” option. This is located in the settings menu and is denoted by a circular button with an “X” in the center. Once you have selected the “Sign Out” option you will be prompted with a confirmation message asking if you are certain that you would like to sign out.</p><p>The second step is to click the “OK” button when prompted. This will take you to the home screen of your Android TV device and you will be completely logged out of your Google account. You can then choose to either sign back in or exit out and use the device without being logged in.</p><p>Finally, if you ever want to completely delete your Google account you can do so through the Google Account Deletion Page. On this page you can select the “Delete” option and follow the instructions on the screen to begin the deletion process. Once your account has been deleted, you will be completely removed from Google and will no longer be able to access any of your data.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/SRcR2xNAkfU style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1: What are the three easy steps to log out of my Google Account from my Android TV?
