This will prevent the app from being used until you unblock it.</p><p>In conclusion, Android phones provide several features to help you monitor your child&rsquo;s screen time. You can check their app usage, set time limits, set alarms, and even block apps if necessary.

Unfortunately, these devices can be quite addictive and controlling the amount of time spent on them is important. Fortunately, monitoring screen time is easy to do on any Android phone.</p><p>The first step is setting up parental controls. This will allow parents to control which apps their children are using and how much time their children spend using them. On most Android phones, parental controls can be found in the settings menu under the “Family & Parenting” section.</p><p>Once the parental control settings are enabled, parents can begin to monitor their child&rsquo;s activities.
