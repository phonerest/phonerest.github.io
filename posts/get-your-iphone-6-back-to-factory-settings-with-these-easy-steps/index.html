Restoring Factory Settings Restoring your iPhone 6 back to factory settings is one of the best ways to ensure the device is running at its peak performance. Before you go ahead with the factory reset, you’ll want to make sure you’ve backed up all of your data and settings on iCloud and iTunes.

Once that’s done, you’re ready to restore your iPhone 6 back to its factory settings.\nThe first step is to open the Settings app and tap on General. From there, scroll down to the bottom of the page and tap on Reset. On the Reset page, tap on the option to Erase All Content and Settings.
