Once the AirPods Pro are found, simply select them and follow the onscreen instructions to complete the pairing. To ensure the best connection quality, it is recommended to perform a test of the AirPods Pro and Android connection. Here&rsquo;s how.</p><p>First, make sure the AirPods Pro are fully charged and that you have the latest version of your Android device&rsquo;s operating system. Next, connect the AirPods Pro to your Android device and launch a music or video streaming app. Make sure the sound is on and the volume is at the highest level. If you hear crisp sound with good clarity, then the AirPods Pro and Android connection is working correctly.</p><p>If the sound is distorted or you encounter other audio problems, then you should try resetting the connection. To do that, disconnect the AirPods Pro from your Android device, then turn off Bluetooth and restart your device. Once your device is restarted, turn on Bluetooth and reconnect the AirPods Pro.</p><p>You can also try toggling the noise cancellation feature when testing the connection. To do this, open the Bluetooth settings menu and find the &lsquo;Noise Cancellation&rsquo; option. Toggle this setting on and off and test the connection quality. If the sound quality improves when you toggle noise cancellation on and off, then the connection is working properly.</p><p>Finally, if you continue to experience audio issues, try disconnecting and reconnecting the AirPods Pro several times. If this doesn&rsquo;t solve the problem, then you should contact Apple support for further assistance.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/blHUsobW5ag style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1.
