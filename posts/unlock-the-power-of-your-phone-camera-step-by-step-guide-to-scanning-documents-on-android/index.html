Scanning Documents<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-scanning-documents>#</a></h3><p>Scanning documents on an Android camera can be a very useful tool for those who need to quickly capture images of important documents. Here are some tips to help you get the best results when using this tool:</p><p>First of all, make sure the document you are scanning is flat and as close to the camera lens as possible. Avoid any shadows falling on the document, since this can make subsequent processing of the image more difficult.</p><p>Make sure you have adequate lighting. If possible, aim to have your lighting coming from in front of the document. This will reduce the risk of glare in the resulting scans.</p><p>If the camera app you are using supports it, use a higher resolution setting when scanning the document. This will ensure that the text is captured clearly and without distortion.</p><p>Finally, be sure to save the resulting scan in a format that is suitable for further processing and sharing. PDF and JPEG are both excellent options. You can also use cloud services to store your scans securely.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/P6vOgae2AJk style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1.
