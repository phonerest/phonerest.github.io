If you need to scan a document on your Android phone, you first need to prepare the documents to be scanned. Make sure that the document is neat, clean, and in a well-lit environment. Place the document on a flat surface, and use a ruler to align the edges of the document. After ensuring the document is properly prepared, you’re ready to begin the scan.

Before you scan any document, the most important things to do is to prepare the documents. Firstly, make sure the document is placed on a flat surface. This will ensure that you get a smooth and good quality of images during the scanning process. Secondly, reduce the shadows by using a lamp or overhead lights. Thirdly, check if you need to adjust the contrast and brightness as needed. Finally, make sure that the document is not wrinkled, folded or torn.
