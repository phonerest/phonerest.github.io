This is needed to re-download any previously purchased apps and music. Once that is done, your phone will be ready to be used like it was when you first got it.</p><p>Finally, take the time to read any of the terms and conditions that are presented, as they are there for a reason and are meant to inform you about using the device. Once all of that is taken care of, your factory reset on your iPhone 8 is now complete. Enjoy your phone!</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/8LgHNRjiekQ style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q: How do I restore my iPhone 8 to factory settings?
