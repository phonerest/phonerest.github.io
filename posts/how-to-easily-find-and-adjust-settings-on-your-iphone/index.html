Locating and Accessing Settings Finding and adjusting settings on an iPhone is one of the fundamental things you’ll need to learn when using your iPhone.

These options will vary depending on the setting, but you’ll usually see a switch to turn the setting on or off, or a slider to adjust the setting to a certain level. If you’re adjusting a complicated setting, there may be more detailed options to choose from.\nWhen you’re finished adjusting the settings, just tap the back button at the top left of the page and you’ll be taken back to the list of settings.

Swipe down on the screen to access the search bar and type in “Settings.” This will lead you to the main Settings page where you can find and adjust the many different settings that an iPhone offers. Users can customize their phones by changing the wallpaper, sound effects, notifications, and privacy options.
