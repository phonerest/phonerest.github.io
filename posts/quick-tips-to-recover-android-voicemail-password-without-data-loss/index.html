Back Up Data Before Resetting the Voicemail Password<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-back-up-data-before-resetting-the-voicemail-password>#</a></h3><p>It is important to protect voicemail passwords in order to prevent unscrupulous individuals from gaining access to another person’s voicemail messages. Here are some best practices to prevent voicemail password loss:</p><ol><li><p>Choose a strong and difficult to guess password. Include a combination of letters, numbers and even symbols to make it more secure. Change your password regularly and do not share your password with anyone.</p></li><li><p>Use two-factor authentication (2FA). This provides an extra layer of security as it requires both your password and a unique code sent to your phone or email for verification.</p></li><li><p>Avoid using the same password for multiple accounts. This will help to ensure that if one of your accounts is compromised, the unauthorised user will not be able to access your voicemail.</p></li><li><p>Regularly back up your voicemail messages. This will ensure that you do not lose any important messages in the event of password loss or theft.</p></li></ol><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ey3-R6-lMNc style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q: What is Android Voicemail?
