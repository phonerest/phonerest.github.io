Reversing the Blocking Process<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#2-reversing-the-blocking-process>#</a></h3><p>Having blocked contacts can be a great way to limit communication with someone you don&rsquo;t want to talk to. However, when the situation changes, it may be necessary to unblock them. There are several reasons why someone may want to unblock a contact. Firstly, it could be a friend or relative who previously may have been blocked but circumstances have changed and you now want them to be able to get in touch. Secondly, it could be for business reasons. It may be necessary to unblock contacts if you are conducting business with them, or need to be able to contact them in the future.</p><p>It is not always easy to find blocked contacts on an Android phone. Depending on your device, you may be able to access these contacts from within an app. For example, if you have Whatsapp installed, you can access blocked contacts from the app. Another option is to look in the Contacts section of your Android phone&rsquo;s settings. This section will show all contacts that are blocked.</p><p>If you don&rsquo;t have the contact listed in either of these locations, you can open the default dialer app on your phone, and type in the contact&rsquo;s number. If they are blocked, then you will get a prompt informing you that the number has been blocked. At this point, you can choose to unblock the contact.</p><p>Finally, you may need to unblock a contact because you have forgotten that they were blocked in the first place. This is easy to do, by simply going to the blocked contacts list in your Android phone&rsquo;s settings, and tapping the contact to unblock them. Unblocking contacts can be beneficial in a variety of situations, so it&rsquo;s important to know how to do this.</p><h2 id=2-outline-how-to-unblock-a-contact-on-android>2.
