Finally, choose the backup you just created and select ‘Restore’. You should then wait until the process is completed, and once finished, all your data from your Android phone will be transferred to your iPhone 11.
By following these steps, you should now have a successful data transfer from your Android to your iPhone 11 - enjoy!</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/mYFnkbj6VAg style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1.
