To turn off your device with ADB commands, you’ll need to do the following:\nOpen the command window on your computer. Connect your device to your computer with a USB cable. Enter the command “adb devices” to confirm the connection between the device and the computer. Finally, type in the command “adb reboot -p” to turn off the device. By following these simple instructions, you can make sure your Android-based device without a touchscreen is turned off with ease.\n1. Installing the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) Android devices without a touch screen may at first appear to be incompatible with some of the standard commands available, but with the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) commands you can still turn them off and perform other useful tasks. To manually turn off an Android device, enter the “adb” command from the platform-tools folder in the SDK directory, followed by the “shell” command, then type “reboot -p”. This will shut down the device. To restart your device, enter the same sequence of commands followed by “reboot”. You can also enter “adb reboot” to restart your device without typing any other commands. Furthermore, advanced users can use the “adb reboot-bootloader” command to boot your phone into the bootloader menu, from where you can access various functions like wiping your data. In conclusion, the Android Debug Bridge can be used to turn off and restart your Android device without a touch screen, and also access several other useful functions.\n2. Using ADB Commands to Shut Down Phone There are times when Android smartphone users may encounter problems such as unresponsive touchscreens or other unknown errors which makes it difficult to shut down their phones. In this article, we will explain how to turn off an Android device without a touchscreen using ADB (Android Debug Bridge) commands.\nTo use ADB commands, users need to first enable USB debugging on the phone. This can be done by going to Settings\u003e About Phone\u003e Software Information\u003e Build Number then tapping the Build Number seven times which will enable the Developer Options. Next, they need to enable USB debugging under Developer Options.\nOnce the USB debugging has been enabled, users can access the ADB commands by connecting the phone to a computer and entering the command “adb devices” on the command prompt window. The device will be listed if it is properly connected.\nFinally, users can turn off their phone by entering “adb shell reboot -p” to the command prompt window. This command will shut down the phone and turn it off without the need for a touchscreen. And that’s it! With the steps above, users can now easily shut down their Android device without a touchscreen.\n3. Explaining how to turn off an Android device without a touchscreen using third-party applications If you’re in need of turning off your Android device without using a touchscreen, there are some third-party applications that can help you. One popular application is the RemoteDroid app. To use the RemoteDroid app, install it from the Google Play Store on your Android device, then open the RemoteDroid app to connect to your device from another device, such as a laptop, by entering the IP address of your Android device. You’ll then be able to remotely control your Android device, and access the shutdown or restart options.\nAnother way to turn off your Android device without a touchscreen is by using the ADB (Android Debug Bridge) command. You’ll need to set up ADB commands on your device, and then use a command prompt to enter certain commands to shut down or restart your device. To make this process easier, you can use an Android application such as ADB Wifi that will allow you to connect your Android device to your laptop or computer using a Wi-Fi connection.\nFor more advanced users, you can use the libreboot project to modify the Android bootloader, allowing you to access the boot menu and power off your device. This process can be difficult as it requires you to install and setup the bootloader, then compile specific files that you’ll need to boot into the boot menu.\nNo matter which method you choose, these are the best ways to turn off your Android device without a touchscreen. Being able to turn off your device without using the touchscreen will be helpful when the touchscreen is unresponsive or broken.\n1.
