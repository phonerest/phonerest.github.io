From the settings menu, select accessibility and then choose the display size. You can increase the display size to make text larger.\nFinally, you can install a custom launcher to get more control over font and display settings. This is especially helpful for older devices that do not have a built-in font size control. Custom launchers give you more control over text size, fonts, colors, and other settings.\nFollowing these 5 steps, you can easily make the text larger on your android phone. No matter your phone model, you can make the text easier to read in a few simple steps.\n1.

These apps can be especially useful for those who need to zoom in to read text.\nIn conclusion, making text larger on an Android phone can be done easily.
